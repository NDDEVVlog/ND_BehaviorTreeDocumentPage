title: Succeeder Node
description: Always returns Success, regardless of its child's result (unless it's Running).
---
import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This decorator ensures that the branch it contains is "optional." It will always return `Success` unless its child is still in a `Running` state. It effectively ignores a `Failure` result from its child.

**Path in Editor:** `Decorator > Succeeder`

### Behavior

The Succeeder node wraps a single child and modifies its result:

-   If its child returns `Success`, the Succeeder returns **`Success`**.
-   If its child returns `Failure`, the Succeeder returns **`Success`**.
-   If its child returns `Running`, the Succeeder returns **`Running`**.

<Aside type="tip">
**When to use it:** In a `Sequence`, you might have an optional action like "Play Taunt Animation". If that animation fails for some reason, you don't want the whole sequence to stop. Wrapping the animation node in a **Succeeder** ensures the sequence will continue regardless of the outcome.

This node has no configurable properties.
