## Overview

**Auxiliary Nodes** are nodes that assist or modify other nodes. They always have a single "parent" node they are attached to or a single "child" they affect. There are two main types of Auxiliary Nodes in this framework: **Decorators** and **Services**.

-   **Decorators:** Wrap a single child node to modify its behavior or outcome (e.g., Inverter, Repeater). They are part of the main execution flow.
-   **Services:** Attach to a Composite node and run periodically in the background as long as the composite is active. They are not part of the main execution flow.
