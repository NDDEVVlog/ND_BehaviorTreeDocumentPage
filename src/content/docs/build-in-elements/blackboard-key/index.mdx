# Key System Overview

The **Key** system is a core part of ND_BehaviorTree's Blackboard. It allows you to store, retrieve, and manage typed data for AI logic in a safe and flexible way.

Keys are used to identify and access values on the Blackboard. Each key has a name and a type, ensuring that only compatible data is stored and retrieved.
