title: Parallel Node
description: Executes all of its children simultaneously.
---
import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Parallel node executes all of its child branches at the same time. Its own success or failure is determined by configurable policies based on the results of its children.

**Path in Editor:** `Composite > Parallel`

### Properties

| Property         | Type   | Description                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `successPolicy`  | Policy | `RequireOne`: Succeeds as soon as one child succeeds. `RequireAll`: Succeeds only when all children have succeeded. |
| `failurePolicy`  | Policy | `RequireOne`: Fails as soon as one child fails. `RequireAll`: Fails only when all children have failed. |

### Behavior

-   **Returns `Success`** or **`Failure`** based on the policies and the status of its children.
-   **Returns `Running`** as long as the conditions for success or failure have not yet been met.

<Aside type="note">
This node is powerful for running a primary task (like moving) while simultaneously running a secondary task (like looking around or playing a walking animation).
