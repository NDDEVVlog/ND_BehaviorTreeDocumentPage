title: Rotate To Target Service
description: Periodically rotates a NavMeshAgent to face the direction it is moving.
---
import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This service, when attached to a Composite node, will smoothly rotate the AI to face its movement direction. It runs on a timer as long as its parent branch is active.

**Path in Editor:** `Service > RotateToTarget`

### Properties

| Property         | Type  | Description                                                        |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `rotationSpeed`  | float | How quickly the agent rotates. Higher is faster.                   |
| `agentKey`       | Key   | The Blackboard key for the `NavMeshAgent` component.               |

<Aside type="note">
This is a **Service**, not a Decorator. It should be added to a Composite node (like a Sequence or Selector) that controls movement. It will run in the background while the movement nodes are executing.
</Aside>

### Behavior

-   On its interval, it checks the `velocity` of the `NavMeshAgent`.
-   If the agent is moving, it calculates the required rotation to look in the direction of movement and smoothly interpolates the agent's current rotation towards it.
