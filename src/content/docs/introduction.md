title: Introduction
description: Welcome to the Behavior Tree System documentation.
---

Ever felt constrained by Unity's built-in Behavior Tree? Wished you could dig into the source code, but couldn't? Found the perfect tool on the Asset Store, only to be stopped by the price?

§(*￣▽￣*)§ Yayyyy. Thank you, AI.

I just want to say that this project is completely free. I hope my Behavior Tree system can help you create better AI.

### My Views
- **Total Freedom**: It's open-source. Modify it, learn from it, and make it your own.
- **Built for You**: I'm constantly adding new features and listening to community feedback.
- **No Barriers**: It's 100% free, forever. Your budget shouldn't limit your creativity.
- **Community**: I hope we can build the most powerful Unity Behavior Tree — together.

**P/S**: Apologies if my sentences or writing are a bit off. I haven’t written an introduction like this before, but I hope you get my point. Thank you very much!
