**Action** nodes are the "leaves" of the Behavior Tree. They are where the work gets done. An Action node represents a specific, concrete action your game character can perform. They cannot have any children.

They are the "verbs" of your AI's brain:
-   `Move To Target`
-   `Play Animation`
-   `Attack Enemy`
-   `Find Cover`
-   `Say Dialogue Line`

## The Life Cycle of an Action

When an Action node is processed, it must return one of three statuses, which dictates the flow of the tree.

-   `Success`: The action was completed successfully. (e.g., "The agent has arrived at its destination.")
-   `Failure`: The action could not be completed. (e.g., "A path to the destination could not be found.")
-   `Running`: The action is in progress and needs more time. The tree will execute this same node again on the next update. (e.g., "The agent is still moving along the path.")

## Creating a Custom Action Node

All of your game-specific logic will live inside custom Action nodes. You create them by inheriting from the `ActionNode` base class.

See the [Creating a Custom Action Node](ND_BehaviorTreeDocumentPage/tutorials/custom-action-node/) tutorial for a detailed walkthrough.

Here is the basic template for any new Action node:

```csharp
using ND_BehaviorTree;
using UnityEngine;

// The NodeInfo attribute adds it to the editor's node creation menu.
[NodeInfo("My Custom Action", "Action/MyCustomAction")]
public class MyCustomActionNode : ActionNode
{
    // OnEnter is called once when the node is first executed.
    // Use it for initialization.
    protected override void OnEnter()
    {
        Debug.Log("Starting my custom action!");
    }

    // OnProcess is called every frame as long as the node returns Running.
    // This is where the main logic lives.
    protected override Status OnProcess()
    {
        // ... do some work ...
        
        // Return Success, Failure, or Running based on the outcome.
        return Status.Success;
    }

    // OnExit is called once when the node stops running (either by succeeding or failing).
    // Use it for cleanup.
    protected override void OnExit()
    {
        Debug.Log("Finished my custom action!");
    }
}
```

Action nodes are the bridge between the abstract logic of the Behavior Tree and the concrete functionality of your game engine and code.
