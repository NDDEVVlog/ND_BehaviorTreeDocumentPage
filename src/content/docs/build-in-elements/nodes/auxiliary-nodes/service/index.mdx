title: Services Overview
description: An overview of Service Nodes, which perform background tasks on a timer.

## Overview

**Service Nodes** are a special type of Auxiliary Node that are **not** part of the main execution flow. Instead, they are attached to a Composite Node and run on a regular, timed interval as long as their parent composite is active in the behavior tree.

Services are perfect for tasks that need to happen periodically in the background, without interrupting the main logic of the tree.

<Aside type="note">
**Key Difference:** Unlike a Decorator, a Service does not wrap a child and does not affect the `Success` or `Failure` status of the branch it's on. It runs in parallel to the composite's children.
</Aside>

Common uses for services include:
- Periodically searching for a player or target.
- Updating a Blackboard value (e.g., the distance to a target).
- Checking an AI's health or other stats.
