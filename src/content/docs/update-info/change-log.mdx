<ChangelogBox version="Version 1.1" title="The Enhancer Update" releaseDate="[Date of Release]">

### üß† Blackboard System
*   **Integrated Blackboard View**: The Blackboard can now be viewed and modified directly within the Behavior Tree Graph editor for a seamless workflow.
*   **Expanded Key Support**: Added a wider variety of key types, allowing for more complex and diverse data storage.
*   **Scene Reference Overrides**: Users can now assign direct object references from the scene to Blackboard keys, overriding default values for specific tree instances.
*   **Type-Safe Key Search**: The `Key` variable and `Key<T>` can now automatically find matching keys in the Blackboard based on their data type, reducing errors and setup time.
*   **Enum & Struct Support**: Full, native support for using custom enums and structs as Blackboard key types.

### üìà Graph Editor Enhancements
*   **Improved Debug Trace**: The visual tracing mode for debugging has been enhanced for clearer visualization of the tree's execution flow.
*   **Node Copy & Paste**: Full support for copying and pasting single nodes or groups of nodes within the graph editor.
*   **Quick Search Menu**: Press the `Spacebar` to instantly open the node search menu, allowing for a much faster workflow.
*   **GameObject-to-Graph Linking**: Selecting a GameObject in the scene hierarchy now automatically opens and focuses its associated Behavior Tree graph.

### üå≥ Behavior Tree & Nodes
*   **New Utility Nodes**: A collection of new, pre-built function nodes has been added to handle common tasks and logic patterns.
*   **Redesigned Node Inspector**: The UI for the node property window has been updated to be clearer and more intuitive.

### üé® Theming & Modding
*   **Custom Node Themes**: The visual appearance of nodes can now be customized via themes.
    <Aside>
      **Future Plans:** Full UXML support for customizing the GraphView, Search menus, and more is planned for a future release.
    </Aside>
*   **Per-Node UI Modding**: Advanced users can now modify the theme and UI behavior for individual node types.

### üß© Plugins & Add-ons
*   **New `SpellTech` Add-on:**
    *   **Dynamic Method Hub**: A powerful new node and system for calling methods dynamically at runtime. *(Documentation coming soon)*
    *   **Helper Script: `GetComp<T>`**: A utility script for efficiently finding components on a GameObject, its parents, or its children.
    *   **Unity Node**: A new node for deeper integration with Unity's engine lifecycle. *(Currently in testing)*
    *   **GOAP System Integration**: Added support for Goal-Oriented Action Planning.

### üìù Attributes
*   **New Attribute: `RequireComponentRunner`**: Ensures the Behavior Tree runner GameObject has all required components before execution, preventing runtime errors. *(Documentation coming soon)*
