Debug nodes don't affect the game logic but are invaluable for understanding what your Behavior Tree is doing at runtime.

## Log Node

Prints a message to the Unity Console. This is useful for tracing the execution path of your tree.

-   **Behavior:** Prints the configured message and immediately returns `Success`.
-   **Properties:**
    -   `Message`: The string to print to the console.
    -   `Log Level`: The type of log (Info, Warning, or Error).

## Wait Node

Pauses the execution of its branch for a specified duration. It's perfect for adding delays or pacing to an AI's behavior.

-   **Behavior:** Returns `Running` for the specified `Duration`. Once the time has elapsed, it returns `Success`.
-   **Properties:**
    -   `Duration`: The time to wait in seconds.
-   **Visuals:** While running, this node displays a progress bar showing the elapsed time, thanks to the `[NodeProgressBar]` attribute.

## Debug Break Node

Pauses the Unity Editor when executed. This is extremely powerful for freezing the game at a specific point in the tree's logic to inspect the state of your game objects, blackboard, and agent.

-   **Behavior:** Calls `Debug.Break()` to pause the editor and then returns `Success`.
-   **Properties:** None.
