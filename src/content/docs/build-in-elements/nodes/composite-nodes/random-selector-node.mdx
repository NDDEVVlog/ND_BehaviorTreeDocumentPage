title: Random Selector Node
description: Randomly selects and runs one child with equal probability.
---
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This composite node randomly picks one of its children to execute, with each child having an equal chance of being selected.

**Path in Editor:** `Composite > RandomSelector`

### Behavior

-   On the first run, it randomly picks one child to execute.
-   It then returns the status of that chosen child (`Success`, `Failure`, or `Running`).
-   If the chosen child returns `Running`, this node will continue to execute that *same* child on subsequent ticks until it finishes. A new random child is only chosen after the previous one has completed.
-   **Returns `Failure`** if it has no children.

### Example Usage
Perfect for idle behaviors where an AI might randomly choose between looking around, scratching its head, or shifting its weight.
