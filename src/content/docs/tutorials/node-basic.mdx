Every element you place in your Behavior Tree graph—from a complex sequence to a simple action—is a **Node**. The `Node` class is the foundational, `abstract` base class from which all other node types are derived. Understanding its structure and lifecycle is key to mastering this system.

Think of it as the `MonoBehaviour` of the Behavior Tree world. You don't use it directly, but you build everything on top of it.

## The Node's Lifecycle

When a Behavior Tree runs, it "ticks" or processes its nodes. Each node follows a specific, predictable lifecycle managed by its `Process()` method.

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="1. OnEnter()" icon="play-circle">
		Called **once** when the node is first activated. This is the perfect place for any setup logic, like initializing variables, caching components, or starting a timer.
	</Card>
	<Card title="2. OnProcess()" icon="sync">
		Called **every tick** as long as the node is active (i.e., it previously returned `Status.Running`). This is where the main logic of your node lives. It must return a `Status` to tell the tree what to do next.
	</Card>
	<Card title="3. OnExit()" icon="stop-circle">
		Called **once** when the node stops processing, either because it returned `Status.Success` or `Status.Failure`. Use this for cleanup, like stopping timers or resetting state.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

<Aside>
The `Process()` method orchestrates this lifecycle. You won't call `OnEnter`, `OnProcess`, or `OnExit` directly; the tree handles this for you. Your job is to fill in the logic for those three methods when creating custom nodes.
</Aside>

## Execution Status

Every time a node's `OnProcess()` method is called, it must return one of three possible statuses. This status informs its parent node how to proceed.

-   **`Status.Success`**: The node has completed its task successfully.
-   **`Status.Failure`**: The node failed to complete its task.
-   **`Status.Running`**: The node is still working and needs more time. The tree will call its `OnProcess()` method again on the next tick.

This `Success`/`Failure` system is how the tree makes decisions and flows from one branch to another.

## Core Properties and Methods

Here’s a breakdown of the most important members of the `Node.cs` class.

### Properties

| Property      | Type            | Description                                                                                                                 |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ownerTree`   | `BehaviorTree`  | A runtime reference to the `BehaviorTree` instance this node belongs to. Crucial for accessing shared components.           |
| `blackboard`  | `Blackboard`    | A convenient shortcut to `ownerTree.blackboard`. Used for reading from and writing to the tree's shared data storage.         |
| `status`      | `Status`        | The current execution status of the node (`Success`, `Failure`, or `Running`).                                              |
| `priority`    | `int`           | Used by certain composite nodes (like a Priority Selector) to determine execution order. Higher numbers mean higher priority. |
| `id`          | `string`        | A unique GUID for the node, used internally by the editor for saving and linking.                                           |
| `position`    | `Rect`          | The node's position on the Behavior Tree editor graph.                                                                      |

### Methods

#### Lifecycle Methods (You Override These)

-   `protected abstract Status OnProcess()`
    The heart of your node. You **must** implement this method in your custom nodes. It contains the logic that runs every tick and must return `Success`, `Failure`, or `Running`.

-   `protected virtual void OnEnter()`
    Override this for setup logic. It's called before the first `OnProcess()`.

-   `protected virtual void OnExit()`
    Override this for cleanup logic. It's called after the node returns `Success` or `Failure`.

#### Core Methods (Managed by the System)

-   `public Status Process()`
    This is the main entry point called by the parent node or the tree itself. It manages the `OnEnter`/`OnProcess`/`OnExit` flow and should not be overridden or called directly.

-   `public virtual Node Clone()`
    Creates a runtime instance of the node. This is essential because your Behavior Tree asset is a template. At runtime, the tree is cloned so that each agent has its own unique instance with its own state.

-   `public virtual void Reset()`
    Resets the node's internal processing state. This is useful if a branch of the tree is aborted.

## The `Node.cs` Script

Here is the full base `Node.cs` script for your reference.

## Core Node Categories

While `Node` is the abstract base, you'll never use it directly in your graph. Instead, you will work with three primary categories of nodes that inherit from it. Each category serves a distinct purpose in the structure and logic of your Behavior Tree.

| Node Category      | Brief Description                                                                                                | Further Information                                                       |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Composite Node** | These nodes are the branches of your tree. They contain and execute a list of child nodes according to a specific rule (e.g., in sequence or by priority). | [Read about Composite Nodes](/ND_BehaviorTreeDocumentPage/build-in-elements/nodes/composite-nodes/)   |
| **Auxiliary Node** | These nodes attach to other nodes to modify their behavior. This category includes **Decorators** (which alter the result or act as condition checker) and **Services** (which run in the background). | [Read about Auxiliary Nodes](/ND_BehaviorTreeDocumentPage/build-in-elements/nodes/auxiliary-nodes/)   |
| **Action Node**    | These are the leaves of your tree. They perform the actual work of your AI, such as moving a character, attacking an enemy, or checking a condition. They have no children. | [Read about Action Nodes](/ND_BehaviorTreeDocumentPage/build-in-elements/nodes/action-nodes/)         |

Understanding these three categories is the first step to designing effective and readable Behavior Trees. The following tutorials will show you how to combine them to create intelligent behavior.
