title: Composite Nodes Overview
description: Composite Nodes are the branches of the behavior tree that control execution flow.

## Overview

**Composite Nodes** are the internal branches of the behavior tree. Their primary purpose is to define the logical flow of execution among their children. They can have one or more children and will process them in a specific order based on the composite's type (e.g., Sequence, Selector).

Composites can also have **Services** attached to them, which are special nodes that run on a timer as long as the composite node is active in the tree.

### Core Concepts
- **Have Children:** Composites are parent nodes that control one or more children.
- **Control Flow:** The type of composite determines how its children are executed.
- **Services:** They can host services that perform background tasks like checking for enemies.
