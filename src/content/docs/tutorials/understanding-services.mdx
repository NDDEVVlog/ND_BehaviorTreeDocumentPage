## What is a Service?

A **Service** is a special type of node that runs in the background on a timer. Unlike Actions or Decorators, it is **not** part of the main execution flow of the tree.

Services are attached to **Composite Nodes** (`Sequence`, `Selector`, etc.). As long as the parent composite node is active (i.e., its branch is being executed), the service will "tick" and perform its logic periodically.

**Use services for:**
- Periodically checking the environment (e.g., "Is the player in attack range?").
- Updating values on the **Blackboard** (e.g., "Set `isTargetVisible` to true/false").
- Monitoring an agent's state (e.g., "Decrease hunger level over time").

<Aside type="danger">
**Important:** Services should **never** be used for direct control flow. They are for observation and data updates only. Their return value is ignored by the parent composite.
</Aside>

## How Services Work

- **Attachment:** You attach a Service to a `CompositeNode` in the editor.
- **Activation:** The service becomes active when its parent `CompositeNode` is first executed.
- **Ticking:** While the composite is active, its `TickServices()` method is called on every `Update`. The service checks internally if enough time has passed since its last execution based on its `interval`.
- **Logic:** If the timer condition is met, the service's `OnTick()` method is executed.

The `ServiceNode.cs` script manages this timing logic for you. You only need to care about the properties and the `OnTick()` method.

- `interval`: The time in seconds between each tick.
- `runOnEnter`: If true, the service will execute its `OnTick()` method immediately when it becomes active, without waiting for the first interval.

## Example: A "Find Target" Service

Let's create a service that periodically scans for a target with a "Player" tag and stores it on the blackboard.

1.  **Create the Script:** Create a new C# script named `FindPlayerTargetService.cs`.

2.  **Add the Code:**

    ```csharp
    using UnityEngine;
    using ND_BehaviorTree;

    // isChildOnly = true hides it from the main node menu, as it can only be attached.
    [NodeInfo("Find Player Target", "Service/FindPlayerTarget", isChildOnly: true)]
    public class FindPlayerTargetService : ServiceNode
    {
        [Tooltip("The tag to search for.")]
        public string targetTag = "Player";

        [Tooltip("The blackboard key to store the found target in.")]
        [ExposeProperty]
        public string targetKey = "Target";

        // OnTick is the main logic method for a Service.
        protected override void OnTick()
        {
            if (blackboard == null) return;

            // Find the closest game object with the specified tag.
            GameObject targetObject = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag(targetTag);
            
            // Set the value on the blackboard. This will either update the existing
            // entry or do nothing if the key doesn't exist.
            // Using SetValueObject is flexible for different key types.
            blackboard.SetValueObject(targetKey, targetObject);
        }
    }
    ```
    
3.  **Compile and Use:**
    - Go to your Behavior Tree editor.
    - Right-click on a `Sequence` or `Selector` node and choose `Add Service -> Service/FindPlayerTarget`.
    - Configure the `targetKey` property on the service to match a `GameObject` key on your blackboard.
    - Now, whenever this part of the tree is active, the service will periodically scan for the player and keep the blackboard updated. Other nodes can then read this `Target` key to make decisions.

<Aside type="note">
Services are the "eyes and ears" of your AI. They keep the blackboard, the AI's "brain", updated with fresh information from the game world.
