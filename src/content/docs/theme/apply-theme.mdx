Once you have created your custom `.uss` file, the final step is to apply it within Unity. This guide will show you how to locate the settings and attach your new theme.

## Applying the Stylesheet

<Steps>
1.  **Open the Settings Asset via the Menu**

    From the top menu bar in Unity, navigate to **ND_BehaviorTree > Settings Asset**. This action will automatically find and select the settings asset in your Project window, showing its properties in the Inspector.

2.  **Inspect the Asset**

    With the settings asset selected, take a look at the Inspector window. You're ready for the next step.

<PasswordPuzzle client:visible password="SubcribeToNDDEVGAMEandSORA">

  {/* 
    The "prize" is the rest of the steps. We nest a new Steps component 
    and use start="3" to continue the numbering correctly.
  */}
  <Steps start={3}>
    3.  **Attach Your Stylesheet**

        In the Inspector, locate the `Node Style Sheets` section. You will see a list of style entries.
        
        Find the entry where the **Node Type** is `Default`. Drag your custom `.uss` file from the Project window into the **Style Sheet** field for this entry.
        
        

    4.  **See the Changes!**

        Open (or re-open) the Behavior Tree editor window. Your new styles should now be applied to the nodes, completely changing their appearance according to your theme!
  </Steps>

### Understanding the Style Types

As you can see in the settings, there are multiple style types:

-   **Default:** This is the main stylesheet that controls the overall appearance of most nodes (Composites, Decorators, Services, etc.). This is the one you will usually want to change.
-   **Auxiliary:** This controls the appearance of smaller, secondary nodes or elements that are part of a larger node, such as Decorator and Service items.
-   **Port:** This specifically controls the styling of the input and output ports on the nodes.
